dawai: Project 
    pychache -> chaching (interpreted vs complied) 
    compiled: faster -> closer to hardware level (convert to machine code then run code) 
    interpreted: slower -> line by line (high level language) 

    settings.py -> added: email-config/apps -> dawaiApp/ debug-> true / static Url

dawaiApp: APPLICATION (Part of Project dawai)
    templates -> html (jinja) = engine to allow writing pyhton in html code 
    static -> css/ images/ js
    views -> render html (connection between backend and frontend),(connection between DB and backend)
    models -> DB 
    test -> test cases (server test "predefined cases")
    admin.py -> register a model in the admin page (take the model from models and add them into admin page.)
    urls -> associate links (urls) with predefined views (call functions to render html pages from views)

manage.py: runserver/ make migrations: create migrations *.py / migrate: apply *.py to the DB 

db.sqllite3: applied migrations (DB).

why SQLLITE not SQL? sqllite faster (lighter)....... no complex queires.......  easier migrations.
                     / other: more complex queries.....
